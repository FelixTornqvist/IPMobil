# Internetprogrammering - Mobila enheter
This repository contains the source code for a bunch of Android apps I made during a course called "Internetprogrammering - Mobila enheter".
Each directory in the root (except for "1.3") contains one app and should be easy to open using Android Studio and Gradle.
