--- How to create and sign an APK in Android Studio ---

1. Build > Generate Signed APK
2. Click "Create new..." button as I had no previous keys.
3. Enter key store path (where to save the key store), I chose "/home/felix/keystores/android-IPMobil.jks"
4. Enter and confirm a password for the keystore
5. Enter name (Alias) for the key, I named it "IPMobil"
6. Enter and confirm password for the key
7. Set Validity (years) to at least 25 (this is how long the key will be valid)
8. Enter following:
	First and Last name:		Felix Törnqvist
	Organizational Unit:		DSV
	Organization:				Stockholm University
	City of Locality:			Märsta
	State or Province:			Uppland
	Country Code:				SE
9. Click OK button
10. Make sure that the correct keystore and key is selected and that the passwords are typed in (should be after creation).
11. click Next button
12. Specify APK destination folder and build type (default should be fine)
13. Check both signature verions; "V1 (Jar Signature)" and "V2 (Full APK Signature)".
13. Click Finish button

the APK should be located in the app/release/ folder inside your project folder
